# Get Out From Hell

## Description

Get Out From Hell is a humorous 3D runner where you control an old man trying to escape from a horde of rats—his greatest fear. The controls are key to the gameplay, as they authentically mimic the movements of an elderly person. To make the character run, you'll have to alternate pressing the left and right arrow keys constantly. Meanwhile, the player can move sideways with A/D, jump with W/S, or use Ctrl and Space for additional jumping and crouching actions.

As you progress through levels, you unlock fire footprints that prevent slipping on ice, increase speed, and use the "fire" resource. These footprints leave fire particles on the ground, adding visual appeal to the gameplay. You also unlock a "flying" mechanic, which is essentially a double jump that propels you forward while consuming fire energy. As the player gains this ability, the protagonist gains fire wings and horns, adding a more demonic appearance.

The game includes several levels where the old man avoids obstacles and tries to outrun the rats. If the rats catch him, he loses. Reaching the end of a level triggers a text note with hints about upcoming levels and gameplay changes.

The game is highly comedic, filled with absurd humor. The rats are cartoonish and sing Macarena while chasing you. The protagonist complains after every movement. Additionally, there are several memes and other humorous elements that pop up throughout the game, keeping the humor flowing.

Note:
This is one of my first projects in Unity 3D. While I can't vouch for the quality of the programming, I can say it's one of the most fun games I've made. The game doesn't represent my current level of knowledge, and the art is not mine.

## Features

* Unique Elderly Controls:

		* To move, you must constantly alternate the left and right arrow keys, simulating the effort of an old man running. Being old has never been this challenging!

* Infernal Power-Ups:

		* Flaming Footsteps: When you unlock this ability, the old man leaves a trail of fire as he walks. This allows him to avoid slipping on ice and gain speed, at the cost of the "Fire" resource. The particles left on the ground are witnesses of your steps.

		* Demon Wings and Horns: Upon reaching certain levels, the old man develops wings and fiery horns. This unlocks a double jump that, besides propelling you forward, gives you a brief "flight." Of course, this also consumes "Fire." 

* Comedy Guaranteed


* The levels are filled with obstacles that don’t hurt you, but slow you down. Like a good old runner, agility is definitely not your strength! 

* At the end of each level, a note is unlocked, revealing a fragment of the story and hints about the upcoming challenges.

## Future Improvements

Although the game is functional and delivers a fun experience, there are several areas that could be improved and expanded upon:

* Code Refactoring & Architecture:

	  * Rebuild the code structure following SOLID principles and applying design patterns.

	  * This would make the game more maintainable, flexible, and ready to scale with new features.

* Enhanced Enemy Behaviors:
	
	  * Aggressive rats that charge faster.

	  * Stealthy rats that hide and ambush.
						
	  *Explosive rats that detonate upon impact.

* Interactive Obstacles:
	  
	  * Make obstacles destructible when collided with.

	  * Add a character animation that reflects the impact.

* Improved UI and Visual Feedback:

	  * Redesign the UI for a more polished look.

	  * Add clearer visual indicators for health, fire resource, and progression.

* Interactive Environment Elements:

	  * Fire pickups that restore fire energy or grant experience.
	  
      * Environmental hazards like falling rocks or lava pools.

	  * Moving platforms or conveyor belts that require strategic navigation.

* New Maps & Level Variety.

* Story and Character Development:

      * Improve the story progression through in-game notes and character reflections during levels.

	  * Add narrative depth to the protagonist’s journey out of hell.

* New Mechanics and Abilities.

* Optimization and bug fixing.
